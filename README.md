# ARDC Note

In short:

*Do not make changes directly to the `lst-agldwg-drupal-module`
Git repository*.

For ARDC-internal people: the most important thing to know is that you
do _not_ "just" make changes to this repository. The contents of this
repository (including of this file!) is the result of a _build
process_.

The changes are prepared in the ARDC-internal `lst-x1-drupal` Git
repository, built, tested, and then copied into this repository. See
the directory `development-processes` directory of the `lst-x1-drupal`
repository for the documentation that explains the process to be
followed.
